            <h2>
                Phase 0: Requirements Specification
            </h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>I need to use Javascript to build a webpage with the DOM instead of HTML.</li>
                    <li>This Javascript webpage will have a calculator that can create objects in the DOM.</li>
                    <li>The user interacting with the webpage will also be able to destroy these DOM objects.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Good Solution</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>It can take all inputs into the calculator, including negative inputs and dividing by zero.</li>
                <li>All of the operations can be deleted in any order. It doesn't matter if it's at the top, bottom, or middle.</li>
                <li>The user interacting with the webpage will be able to follow all of the prompts necessary.</li>
                <li>It also won't crash when you pass in a string.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Challenges</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Understanding Javascript will be a challenge for sure. I've never used Javascript before, so I will definitely need to do my research.</li>
                <li>I'll need to learn the syntax for changing the div color dynamically at the users will.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Knowns</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Creating the divs shouldn't be too bad. I've done that before on a lot of different assignments.</li>
                <li>Evaluating expressions also should be pretty easy.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>
            Phase 1: System Analysis
        </h2>

            <h3>Data</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>There will be data created in the JavaScript. That will be the only place that the data is coming from to create the HTML.</li>
                <li>There will be some data coming from the stylesheet to help out with some of the divs.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Output</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>It will be a calculator that is fully created by JavaScript.</li>
                <li>This calculator can evaluate expressions that are put into it.</li>
                <li>It will also be able create and remove divs of the expressions that were completed.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Algorithms</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>CreateDiv - We create the div that is going to be used to show the expression.</li>
                <li>CreateErrorDiv - Similar to the CreateDiv, but it is going to be used to create the divs that come up when an error is found.</li>
                <li>Evaluating Expression - It just takes the 2 input values and an operand and computes the end value.</li>
            </ul>

        </div>

        <div style="background-color: lightgreen">

        <h2>
            Phase 2: Design
        </h2>

        CreateDiv
        <pre>
            <code>
                path('', views.index, name='index')
            </code>
        </pre>

        createErrorDiv 
        <pre>
            <code>
                var createErrorDiv = function() {
                    var div = document.createElement('div');
	                ...
                    # Set attributes for the div here along with the text.
                    ...
                    document.body.appendChild(div);
	                return render(request, 'blog/index.html');
            }
            </code>
        </pre>

        evaluateExpression - This algorithm seemed extremely straight forward, but we will see what happens in the code.
        <pre>
            <code>
                var evaluateExpression = function(firstNum, secondNum, operand) {
                    return eval(firstNum + operand + secondNum);
                }
            </code>

            Phase 3: Implementation
        </h2>
        
        <h3>Problems/Learning</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>My Pseudocode was not the most helpful to me during this assignment. I felt like it was such a mountain to overcome that I just had to keep going back to the tutorial and videos over and over.</li>
            <li>Also, I felt like it was extremely difficult to write the Pseudocode because I had no idea what Django was supposed to look like.</li>
            <li>Making sure that every bit of your Django app runs well during the tutorial is key. I had a few bugs from the tutorial, and I ended up having similar bugs on the assignment.</li>
            <li>I learned that Django is hard, but it is kinda sick.</li>
        </ul>

            I made sure to go to every page and click on every link that was available and they all worked. I can click the submit button on comments with no information and it is fine. The most errors came from:

        <ul>
            <li>Comment View</li>
            <li>Migrate</li>
            <li>Small syntax mistakes</li>
        </ul>
        
            I deleted some files from the migrations folder by accident and had an hour error just trying to fix it. I ended up deleting my pycache folder and deleting all of the migration files then remigrating and it fixed it. The comment View was the hardest part to figure out for sure and there was a lot of bugs with getting it to redirect to the right page. Here is also some code that helped me to figure out my migration issue.

            This helped me to see if the migration was working after I accidentally deleted it.

            What parts of your program are sloppily written and hard to understand?
            <ul>
                <li>I feel like my views are slightly difficult to understand. Specifically the comment view, it just was so difficult to get the comment view to work that the syntax struggled.</li>
            </ul>
            
            Are there parts of your program which you aren’t quite sure how/why they work?
            <ul>
                <li>The views were a little confusing to me, but the most confusing part to me was the foreignKey. There was so many times when it was passed into a function and I didn't understand what it was doing.</li>
            </ul>
        
            If a bug is reported in a few months, how long would it take you to find the cause?
            <ul>
                <li>This one would take me a very long time to figure out. I would be able to find the location of the bug, but fixing it would be hard.</li>
            </ul>
            
            Will your documentation make sense to anybody besides yourself?    
            <ul>
                <li>I think my documentation isn't the best for this assignment.</li>
            </ul>
        
            yourself in six month’s time?   
            <ul>
                <li>I would definitely have to look over the files for a long time to understand it.</li>
            </ul>
        
            How easy will it be to add a new feature to this program in a year?    
            <ul>
                <li>It wouldn't be that bad if you know Django. I think that adding something new is very feasible.</li>
            </ul>
        
            Will your program continue to work after upgrading
                your computer’s hardware?
            <ul>
                <li>Definitely.</li>
            </ul>
           
                the operating system?   
            <ul>
                <li>Definitely.</li>
            </ul>
         
                to the next version of Python? 
            <ul>
                <li>Possibly. I don't know with Django.</li>
