            <h2>
                Phase 0: Requirements Specification
            </h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>I need to use Javascript to build a webpage with the DOM instead of HTML.</li>
                    <li>This Javascript webpage will have a calculator that can create objects in the DOM.</li>
                    <li>The user interacting with the webpage will also be able to destroy these DOM objects.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Good Solution</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>It can take all inputs into the calculator, including negative inputs and dividing by zero.</li>
                <li>All of the operations can be deleted in any order. It doesn't matter if it's at the top, bottom, or middle.</li>
                <li>The user interacting with the webpage will be able to follow all of the prompts necessary.</li>
                <li>It also won't crash when you pass in a string.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Challenges</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Understanding Javascript will be a challenge for sure. I've never used Javascript before, so I will definitely need to do my research.</li>
                <li>I'll need to learn the syntax for changing the div color dynamically at the users will.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Knowns</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Creating the divs shouldn't be too bad. I've done that before on a lot of different assignments.</li>
                <li>Evaluating expressions also should be pretty easy.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>
            Phase 1: System Analysis
        </h2>

            <h3>Data</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>There will be data created in the JavaScript. That will be the only place that the data is coming from to create the HTML.</li>
                <li>There will be some data coming from the stylesheet to help out with some of the divs.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Output</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>It will be a calculator that is fully created by JavaScript.</li>
                <li>This calculator can evaluate expressions that are put into it.</li>
                <li>It will also be able create and remove divs of the expressions that were completed.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Algorithms</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>CreateDiv - We create the div that is going to be used to show the expression.</li>
                <li>CreateErrorDiv - Similar to the CreateDiv, but it is going to be used to create the divs that come up when an error is found.</li>
                <li>Evaluating Expression - It just takes the 2 input values and an operand and computes the end value.</li>
            </ul>

        </div>

        <div style="background-color: lightgreen">

        <h2>
            Phase 2: Design
        </h2>

        createDiv - Functionally only difference between createDivs is that the information inside the div is exclusive to each of the createDivs.
        <pre>
            <code>
                var createDiv = function() {
                    ...
                    # Check if should go to createErrorDiv()
                    ...
                    var div = document.createElement('div');
	                ...
                    # Set attributes for the div here along with the text.
                    # Make sure the div can be removed!
                    ...
                    document.body.appendChild(div);
            </code>
        </pre>

        createErrorDiv - This is only for the red Error divs.
        <pre>
            <code>
                var createErrorDiv = function() {
                    var div = document.createElement('div');
	                ...
                    # Set attributes for the div here along with the text.
                    # Make sure the div can be removed!
                    ...
                    document.body.appendChild(div);
            }
            </code>
        </pre>

        evaluateExpression - This algorithm seemed extremely straight forward, but we will see what happens in the code.
        <pre>
            <code>
                var evaluateExpression = function(firstNum, secondNum, operand) {
                    return eval(firstNum + operand + secondNum);
                }
            </code>
        </pre>

            <h3>Problems/Learning</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>I just jumped into the assignment and making a lot of mistakes which helped me understand JavaScript a lot better.</li>
                    <li>There was a lot of small things that Javascript did that was not intuitive, it took me a lot longer to deal with some of the problems that I thought were easy.</li>
                    <li>Also, the things that I thought would be hard, weren't as hard as I thought they would be.</li>

            Steps to open the file.
            
            <ul>
                <li>Navigate to the directory with the index.html</li>
                <li>Open the index.html in your browser.</li>
                <li>It should open the JavaScript calculator.</li>
                <li>Leave the Input boxes empty and just hit compute</li>
                <li>A red div should come up with an error.</li>
                <li>Remove the div by clicking on the red box (div).</li>
                <li>Now try to divide by zero.</li>
                <li>Infinity should come up as the answer.</li>
                <li>You are now free to do with the calculator as you please as the testing is complete.</li>

            What parts of your program are sloppily written and hard to understand?
            <ul>
                <li>The global variables I created. I wanted them to be in a function, but I tried to move the code around and it wasn't working in the way I wanted it to.</li>
            </ul>
            
            Are there parts of your program which you aren’t quite sure how/why they work?
            <ul>
                <li>Not really. I think I understand most of what is going on. I mostly just encounterd syntax errors from JavaScript.</li>
            </ul>
        
            If a bug is reported in a few months, how long would it take you to find the cause?
            <ul>
                <li>I would be able to find it quite easily.</li>
            </ul>
            
            Will your documentation make sense to anybody besides yourself?    
            <ul>
                <li> I think so, it is pretty straight forward. </li>
            </ul>
        
            yourself in six month’s time?   
            <ul>
                <li>Definitely it's not a difficult program.</li>
            </ul>
        
            How easy will it be to add a new feature to this program in a year?    
            <ul>
                <li>Super easy. It's a small program.</li>
            </ul>
        
            Will your program continue to work after upgrading
                your computer’s hardware?
            <ul>
                <li>Definitely.</li>
            </ul>
           
                the operating system?   
            <ul>
                <li>Definitely.</li>
            </ul>
                to the next version of Python? 
            <ul>
                <li>Doesn't matter as much with JavaScript.</li>
            </ul>
